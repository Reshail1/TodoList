Here the steps to follow:
1- Please do 'npm install' after extracting these files. 
2- Then open mysql workbench and copy commands (1-9 lines) from 
    'db.sql' and paste them there. This will create your database names as 'fiverr' 
    if you want to change db name, you can do it by replacing 'fiverr' by the name of your choice.
3- Then do 'npm start'. This will start both API and angular server.
